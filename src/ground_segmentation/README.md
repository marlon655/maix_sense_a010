## Motivation

Reliable ground segmentation is a fundamental prerequisite for:
- Obstacle detection
- Traversability estimation
- Navigation and planning
- Mapping and localization

False positives (classifying ground as obstacles) can directly compromise safety and downstream decision-making.  
GSeg3D is explicitly designed to **maximize precision while maintaining robust recall**, even in cluttered and unstructured environments.

## Algorithm Overview

GSeg3D paper performs **two-phase grid-based ground segmentation**. For a reference implementation of the two-phase approach, see the ROS 2 node available [here](https://github.com/dfki-ric/ground_segmentation_ros2/blob/c370b2be20c75dc9fb9e6710f933ab1328fa0981/src/ground_segmentation_ros2_node.cpp#L241).

### [Phase I – Coarse Segmentation](https://github.com/dfki-ric/ground_segmentation_ros2/blob/c370b2be20c75dc9fb9e6710f933ab1328fa0981/src/ground_segmentation_ros2_node.cpp#L84C8-L84C29)
- Uses **larger vertical grid cells**
- Aggressively captures elevated structures as non-ground
- Ensures high initial precision
- May temporarily over-segment ground in cluttered areas

### [Phase II – Refinement](https://github.com/dfki-ric/ground_segmentation_ros2/blob/c370b2be20c75dc9fb9e6710f933ab1328fa0981/src/ground_segmentation_ros2_node.cpp#L91C8-L91C30)
- Uses **smaller vertical grid cells**
- Re-evaluates ground points from Phase I
- Corrects false positives and false negatives from Phase I
- Enforces vertical consistency constraints

This dual-phase strategy strikes a strong balance between precision and recall, a trade-off that is especially important in safety-critical systems.

## Processing Pipeline

Each phase follows the same four core steps:

1. **Grid Representation**
   - The point cloud is discretized into a regular 3D grid
   - Each point is assigned to a cell based on configurable cell sizes

2. **Local Eigen Classification**
   - Per-cell covariance matrix and eigen decomposition
   - Cells classified as:
     - `LINE` (dominant linear structure)
     - `PLANE` (surface-like structure)
     - `NOISE` (scattered points)

3. **Surface Gradient Analysis**
   - Robust plane fitting using **PCL SACSegmentation (PROSAC)**
   - Slope estimation relative to gravity (world frame)
   - Planar cells exceeding slope thresholds are rejected as ground

4. **Ground Region Expansion**
   - Candidate ground cell centroids are indexed using a **KD-tree (nanoflann)**
   - Radius-based neighborhood expansion ensures connectivity
   - Works even when grid resolution is finer than LiDAR scan-line spacing
   - Phase II additionally enforces height-difference constraints

## Key Design Contributions

### KD-Tree–Based Ground Expansion
Traditional grid-neighbor expansion fails at high grid resolutions due to scan-line gaps.  
GSeg3D overcomes this by:
- Indexing ground centroids in a KD-tree
- Performing radius-based spatial expansion
- Enabling fine grid resolutions without loss of connectivity or recall

### Robust Seed Initialization
- Synthetic seed points are injected directly beneath the robot
- Ensures reliable ground initialization even with occlusions or sparse data
- Synthetic points are removed before final output and evaluation

### Multi-Step Ground Verification
Each candidate cell undergoes:
- Plane inlier / outlier separation
- Bounding-box sparsity analysis
- Neighborhood height consistency checks
- Floating-cell rejection (non-ground below)

Only physically plausible and spatially coherent cells are labeled as ground.


## Implementation Details

To generate the HTML documentation for this library:

### System Requirements

OS: Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04

### Dependencies

- CMake
- PCL  
- Eigen3  
- GoogleTest  
- NanoFlann

Example (Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake libpcl-dev libeigen3-dev libgtest-dev libnanoflann-dev
```

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfki-ric/ground_segmentation.git
cd ground_segmentation && mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
make
```

### Generating Documentation

1. Make sure you have **Doxygen** and **Graphviz** installed:

```bash
sudo apt install doxygen graphviz
```

2. From the root of the project, run CMake and build the `doc` target:

```bash
cmake --build . --target doc
```

3. After building, open the generated HTML documentation `doc/html/index.html` in your browser

> The main page will include the README and automatically list the header files and classes.

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir test/ --output-on-failure
```

or

```bash
./test/test_pointcloud_grid
```

### Core Class

```cpp
template<typename PointT>
class PointCloudGrid;
```

### Main API

```cpp
PointCloudGrid(const GridConfig& config);

void setInputCloud(
    pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr input,
    const Eigen::Quaterniond& R_body2World
);

std::pair<
    pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr,
    pcl::PointCloud<PointT>::Ptr
> segmentPoints();
```

## Typical Configuration 
Below is a recommended baseline setup for most outdoor mobile robotics use cases (e.g., LiDAR-based UGVs). Adjust values based on sensor height, terrain roughness, and map resolution.

Phase-I
```yaml
cellSizeX: 1.0
cellSizeY: 1.0
cellSizeZ: 10.0   # Phase I
slopeThresholdDegrees: 20.0
groundInlierThreshold: 0.125
centroidSearchRadius: 5.0
distToGround: -1.723 # (e.g. SemanticKITTI)
maxGroundHeightDeviation: 0.1
```
Phase-II

After coarse ground detection of Phase-I, Phase II increases vertical resolution to refine classification. All parameters are kept same as Phase-I expect for the `cellSizeZ`
```
cellSizeZ: 1.0
```

## Tests & Visualisation

This directory contains **unit tests** and a **visual debugging tool** for the
`PointCloudGrid` ground segmentation implementation.

The code uses **PCL**, **Eigen**, and **GoogleTest** and is intended for quick
validation of grid indexing, ground classification logic, and phase-based
segmentation behaviour.

### Contents

- `test_pointcloud_grid.cpp`  
  GoogleTest-based **unit tests** covering:
  - Grid indexing and hashing
  - Flat ground detection
  - Vertical structures as obstacles
  - Phase 1 vs Phase 2 behaviour
  - Orientation / gravity influence
  - Robustness against empty inputs

- `test_visual_segmentation.cpp`  
  A **visual inspection tool** that:
  - Loads a `.pcd` or `.ply` point cloud
  - Runs **phase 1 + phase 2** ground segmentation
  - Displays ground (green) and obstacles (red) using PCLVisualizer

### Notes

- Phase 1 allows vertical and slanted propagation from the robot seed cell.
- Phase 2 refines ground classification using only previously detected ground.
- Orientation (`Eigen::Quaterniond`) is interpreted as sensor → world rotation.
